# GetirTodo

## Project:

We would like you to build a simple "to-do" app which consists of tasks in list and task detail in detail screen.

### Requirements:

* A task should consist of a title and details
* Tasks' titles should be shown in a list
* Tasks can be deleted in listing screen
* To see the detail of a task, a user should be able to navigate to detail screen
* A user should be able to save, delete and update a task in detail screen

### Technical Requirements:

* Feel free to use any architecture or design pattern
* Do not use any reactive paradigm (SwiftUI, RxSwift etc.) 
* You can build the user interface with XIBs or Storyboards
* Do not try to build a fancy UI
* Keep code as clean as possible
* For the local storage, you should use Realm or CoreData
* Git usage will be evaluated
* A README.md which shortly describes technical details/decisions
* We do not expect to see any UI or unit tests
* There should not be any necessity to use a third party framework (other than Realm, if you chose it)

### Submission:

After completing the assignment, create a pull request to `main` branch.
Then please send an email to the People Department with the link of the GitHub repo.
